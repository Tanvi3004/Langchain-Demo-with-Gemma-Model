# Langchain-Demo-with-Gemma-Model

This project demonstrates how to use the Langchain framework with the Gemma model (or any other model supported by Ollama) to create a simple question-answering application. The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface and Langchain for handling the language model interactions. Additionally, LangSmith is integrated for activity tracking, allowing you to monitor and debug your Langchain workflows.
